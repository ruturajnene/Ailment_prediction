<li>For a seated hamstring stretch sit so the knee of your right leg is bent and the bottom of your right foot is pressed against the inside of the left thigh. Stretch out your left leg ahead of you flat on the ground, and slowly lean down toward your left foot.
Remember to switch legs after each stretch and repeat on the opposite side.</li>
